# Tulacikovia

## Project description:
This project was created as part of the 9th annual [Live IT Projects](https://kpi.fei.tuke.sk/sk/content/zive-it-projekty).
The main goal was to create a web and mobile application that would allow animal shelters and other similarly focused non-profit organizations to create a network of supporters and volunteers.
Through the created network, shelters will be able to provide mass information about current needs or volunteer activities.
